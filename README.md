## Installation

### Requirements
- PHP 8.1+
- MySQL / MariaDB
- Apache with `mod_rewrite` enabled (or any web server supporting PHP)

### Steps

1. **Clone or extract** the project into your web server's root (e.g., `htdocs/lms` for XAMPP):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dnsakibss/LIBRARY-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM-Web_Tech_Project.git lms
   ```
   ```
   htdocs/
   └── lms/
   ```

2. **Create the database** using the schema in `config/schema.sql`:
   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p -e "CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS library_ms"
   mysql -u root -p library_ms < config/schema.sql
   ```
   Or create a database named `library_ms` in phpMyAdmin and import `config/schema.sql` into it.

3. **Configure the database connection** in `config/db.php`:
   ```php
   define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');
   define('DB_USER', 'root');
   define('DB_PASS', '');
   define('DB_NAME', 'library_ms');
   ```

4. **Set the base URL** in `config/app.php` to match your local environment:
   ```php
   define('BASE_URL', 'http://localhost/lms/');
   ```

5. **Ensure the uploads directory is writable:**
   ```bash
   chmod -R 775 public/uploads/
   ```

6. **Open the app** in your browser:
   ```
   http://localhost/lms/
   ```

## Default Credentials

The database seed may include a default admin account. Check `config/schema.sql`, or create a user through the registration page and change their role in the `users` table.

---

## Default Lending Policy (System-wide)

These defaults apply when a branch has no custom policy set:

| Setting | Default |
|---|---|
| Fine rate | 5.00 / day |
| Max loan duration | 14 days |
| Max books borrowed | 5 |
| Max renewals | 2 |

Branch managers can override these per branch via the **Policies** panel.

---

## User Roles

| Role | Access Level |
|---|---|
| `member` | Self-service borrowing, reservations, fines |
| `librarian` | Book and loan management within a branch |
| `branch_manager` | Branch oversight, policies, reports |
| `admin` | Full system access |

Role-based access is enforced server-side via the `requireLogin(...$roles)` helper in `config/app.php`.
